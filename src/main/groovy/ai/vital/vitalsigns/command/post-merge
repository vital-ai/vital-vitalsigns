# This hook is invoked by git merge, which happens when a git pull is done on a local repository. 
# The hook takes a single parameter, a status flag specifying whether or not the merge being done was a squash merge. 
# This hook cannot affect the outcome of git merge and is not executed, if the merge failed due to conflicts.
# This hook can be used in conjunction with a corresponding pre-commit hook to save and restore any form of 
# metadata associated with the working tree (eg: permissions/ownership, ACLS, etc). See contrib/hooks/setgitperms.perl
# for an example of how to do this.
